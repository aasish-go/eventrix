# Eventrix
Eventrix is a modern, pluggable, event-driven framework for building scalable, observable distributed systems in Go. It provides a unified EventBus abstraction, built-in retries, dead letter queues, tracing, and metrics â€” helping teams implement clean, reliable event-driven architectures with minimal boilerplate.
